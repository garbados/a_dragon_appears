# All Dragons Must Die

Everything is made of traits: characters, equipment, events, conflicts, magic -- everything. Wherever traits help, things get easy. Wherever they hurt, you get karma.

To play, you may want but do not need:

* Something to write on
* Something to write with

There, the narrator will note all existing characters, their traits, their durability, their equipment, and their karma. You may also want something to map out in-game spaces with, such as more paper.

## Character Development

To play, just dive into the adventure. The first three things your character attempts automatically succeed. Each of those initial successes confers a trait related to the task. Reasoning being, if you thought you could, you can. After that, you've got to pit your traits against contenders and hope for the best. (see: conflict)

> For example, Sarah starts with a character they name Jack. Jack gets up off the floor, which doesn't earn a trait because there was no conflict involved in getting up. Jack tries to unlock a door, succeeds, and earns some trait related to lockpicking, such as 'Lockpicking', 'Curiosity', 'Subterfuge', 'Machinery', 'Cleverness', etc.

After an intense story arc, characters can gain a trait reflecting their efforts during the arc.

You can also spend karma to get traits. (see: karma)

You can have multiple ranks of a trait by acquiring that trait multiple times. when tallying traits, tally the ranks of your traits. All traits start with one rank.

## Conflict

Conflict happens when things disagree. "I want to pick the lock." "Well, the lock doesn't want to get picked." Conflict!

Tally up your relevant traits, subtract your foe's relevant traits, and play rock-paper-scissors. If the difference is in your favor, you only need to win one round to win the conflict. If the difference is in yours foe's favor, you need to win as many rounds as one plus the difference to win the conflict.

> Jack tries to pick a lock. Jack has Lockpicking 2, but the lock has Difficult Lock 3. `2 - 3 = -1`, so the difference is not in Jack's favor: he will need to win two rounds of rock-paper-scissors (`1 + |-1| = 2`). If Jack loses any round, he fails to pick the lock.

When you win a conflict, you get to dictate how and why and what that means.

> Q: What are 'relevant traits'?
>
> A: Traits that reasonably apply to the conflict. If you think a trait applies but the group disagrees, the group wins.

By working together, different characters can combine relevant traits in a conflict.

In general, you can't retry conflicts. If the other party consents to a re-match, or otherwise wants to continue fighting, you can conflict again.

## Conflicts Without an Obvious Foe

When an action has a reasonable chance of failure, but you're not clearly contesting another entity, assign traits to whatever's causing a reasonable chance of failure, and proceed with conflict normally.

> Jack attempts to leap across a chasm. It's very possible that Jack will plummet into the darkness, so the narrator assigns Long 2 to the space between each cliff, and has Jack conflict with that.

How many traits should you assign to a non-entity like this? use this guide, based on how sophisticated the task at hand is:

* simple: 1 trait
* moderate: 2 traits
* complex: 3 traits
* hard: 4 traits
* virtually impossible: 5 traits
* impossible: 6+ traits

Only impose conflicts where it is narratively compelling to do so. Unless it's fun and interesting, why slow down gameplay with rules?

Alternatively, the narrator may assign as many traits as you know the party can bring to bear, plus or minus how much you want the party to succeed or fail. Though, as a rule, if you have narrative designs that differ from the goals of the players, you should change your narrative to match their goals.

## Durability

Durability represents an entity's fortitude, endurance, luck, and otherwise its continued capacity to maintain structural integrity. It's analogous to Hit Points in other roleplaying games.

Characters have 10 durability. When they lose a physically threatening conflict, this durability is reduced by the margin of defeat -- that is, how many rounds of rock-paper-scissors the player would still have had to win to win the conflict. 

When a character's durability hits zero, they go unconscious. When it hits -10, they die. Durability regenerates at 1 point every day, 2 if you spent the day resting, or more if you're under good medical care.

> Q: Wait, you can recover from near-death in 10 days by just sleeping?
>
> A: Yep. Realism.

## Karma

When you would win a conflict, you can opt to fail by citing a trait, gaining karma equal to your margin of victory (that is, how many rounds your foe still needed to win to avoid defeat).

> say Jack tries to unlock a door, and succeeds by a margin of 5. however, Sarah wants karma, so they cite Jack's 'Panicky' trait and say he broke his tools trying to unlock the door. The door remains locked, but Jack gains 5 karma.

You can blow points of karma to gain favor in a conflict, like bonus traits that apply only to that conflict.

> For example, if your traits tally to 2 in a given conflict, you can spend 3 karma to raise the total to 5. That bonus goes away once the conflict at hand gets resolved.

You can also spend 5 karma to gain a trait from the next conflict you win. The trait you gain should relate to the conflict.

> Say Sarah spent 5 karma to gain a trait from Jack's next victory. Jack sneakily garrotes a goblin, and gains a trait like 'Sneaky', 'Silent', 'Violent', 'Strangler', etc.

Or, you can spend 10 karma to lay down a fact about the world.

> Sarah spends 10 karma to dictate that there is a Thieves Guild with chapters in every major city. Sarah specifies that the guild is led by a flamboyant sentient flan, but everyone thinks it's led by a house cat called Penumbra. Jack has heard of the Thieves Guild, but isn't involved (yet).

Facts can never overwrite each other, though they can play off of each other.

> Sam decides to also spend karma to lay down a fact, specifically that the Thieves Guild abhors killing but cherishes stealing sentimental mementos.

Players can pool karma to add facts to the world.

## Karma Deficits

If something happens which gives your character traits, you must pay for these new traits in karma, at a rate of 5 karma per trait. If you don't have enough karma, you rack up a karma deficit. That is, you have negative karma, and cannot use karma for anything except paying off the deficit until the deficit is paid off.

> A vampire bites Jack, giving him Undead 1, Lusts for Blood 2, and Hates Sunlight 1 -- four traits in all. Jack has 4 karma unspent when this happens, so tallies up a deficit of `(4 * 5) - 4` or -16. Jack's next 16 karma will necessarily go to paying off the deficit. Until it's paid off, Jack won't be able to use karma.

## Equipment

Items have traits too. When you're using equipment, those traits apply to you. Just like your own traits, where they help, things get easier. That said, you can only use so much equipment in one conflict:

* 1 armor
* 1 weapon or tool

What's armor, a weapon, or a tool? I dunno. When that question becomes relevant in a conflict, consult your group.

The cost of different items will vary between campaigns, countries, towns, etc., but as a guideline, a piece of equipment costs the sum of its traits' ranks, squared.

> Say Jack bought a spiked shield with one rank of 'Spiky' and two ranks of 'Blocking'. If the campaign's setting uses dollars ($), the shield would cost Jack $9, or (2+1)^2.

If something is rare or plentiful, the narrator can either manually adjust prices to reflect supply, or use this handy guide:

* rare items: increase cost by 1.5x, rounded down. (ex: 3 traits would cost $9, but costs $13 instead)
* plentiful items: decrease cost by 1/2, rounded down. (ex: 3 traits would cost $9, but costs $4 instead)

> Jack comes to the nomadic village of a horse-oriented people. They've had a particularly bountiful breeding season, and have more mounts now than they need. Jack picks out a light, energetic horse (Energetic 1, Fast 5) which would cost 36 gold in a city, but the nomads settle for 18 gold.

## Creatures

Non-player characters are built out of traits too. If you're building baddies for the party to face, try not to let the sum of the baddies' traits exceed that of the party's.

Here are some example baddies:

### Goblins

> Goblins are smelly, crude, and fierce. Although individually weak, they reproduce quickly even in the harshest environments, and frequently band together into small hunting packs. When driven by forces significantly more potent than themselves, they can group together by the hundreds, and even thousands.

Smelly 1, Fierce 1, Cowardly 1

Usually equipped with crude weapons, such as rock spears (Sharp 1) or stone clubs (Bludgeoning 1).

### Skeleton

> Raised by dark magic, skeletons are the animated remains of the dead. Even as the flesh falls from their bones, skeletons press on by force of the sorcery that made them, hardening them against mortal weapons.

Undead 2, Enduring 1

Usually equipped with cracked and aged equipment, like a rusted breastplate (Tough 1, Rusty 1), and cracked battle axe (Sharp 2, Rusty 1)

### Vampire

> Cold, wanton, and immortal, vampires are made either through powerful magic or by one vampire infecting a mortal, transforming them into a new vampire. Because they appear in undeath mostly as they did in life, they live and walk amongst mortal races unseen, feeding on the living in secret. Vampires appear deathly pale, and cold as the dead -- primarily because they are, in fact, dead.

Undead 1, Lusts for Blood 2, Hates Sunlight 1

Usually equipped with the trappings of an equivalent mortal of their station.

Vampires can create other vampires by draining some but not all of the blood from a victim. The victim goes unconscious for one day, dies of hypothermia, and two days later, arises as a vampire. The new vampire retains all traits from when they were alive, but gains the traits of a vampire too. (Likewise, vampires you encounter may have traits from before they turned, too)

Victims which vampires drain completely die of blood loss, and do not return to life.

For tradition's sake, you can also give vampires traits like Hates Garlic or Hates Holy Water or Vulnerable to Stakes Through the Heart, etc.

## Narrating

Because the game should be fun to watch, follow the rules of "Yes, and": if characters want something, give it to them. If a player wants to try something, let them try it. if doing either would imbalance gameplay, involve complicating circumstances that balance things out. But, where possible, avoid saying No.

> Sam decides her character, Kay, wants to be king, and spends 10 karma to lay down the fact "Kay is King". The narrator says, OK, but adds that while Kay is indeed the rightful king via complicated rules of lineage, numerous others also hold claim to the throne, and may or may not want Kay dead.
