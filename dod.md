# Dirge of Dragons

Like `All Dragons Must Die`, but a little more serious.

## Differences

Some settings may limit the traits characters can take, to focus them around the setting. (see: settings)

Physical conflicts between two sentient parties now enjoy tactics. (see: combat)

Flip physics the finger in four exciting ways. (see: magic)

Settings may have playable races and species characterized by different traits. (see: races)

## Settings

To set expectations of the campaign and better clarify what traits do what, narrators can limit the selection of traits available. Here are some examples:

### Fantasy

TODO

### Cyberpunk

TODO

### Steampunk

TODO

### Survival

TODO

## combat

Combat is physical conflict between two or more sentient parties. 

> Hitting a rock is not combat unless the rock can consciously hit back.

When combat starts, involved parties pick turn order like this: whoever blurts out what they do first, goes first. Proceed clockwise from there. To rearrange turn order, players can swap seats. The narrator manages turns for any baddies. Anyone not aware of combat when combat begins goes last. If, even when it comes to their turn, they remain unaware of combat, they continue to act normally.

On each player's turn, they can take up to two actions:

* move: you travel (run, leap, fly, drive, etc) 10 ft + 5 ft per relevant trait.
* attack: you attempt to harm another character. engage that character in conflict.
* focus: your next action gains +2, unless you're attacked before you can take it. You can focus up to three times, consecutively.
* defend: you gain +2 to resist the next attack against you.
* something else: you do something not necessarily combat-related, like picking a lock.

Bonuses to actions are just like the bonuses one might gain from spending karma to improve trait tallies.

In game time, each round is about five seconds.

## Magic

There are many ways to conceive of magic. here are a few:

### Extramundane

Artisans will can make even the impossible seem effortless. 

> You see a trickster holding someone's wallet, but you swear the trickster never even reached for their pocket. Well, maybe they didn't...

As characters grow more powerful in particular traits, they can begin to accomplish the seemingly impossible: forging hot steel without any tools, locking doors that have no locks, conjuring fire from fingers snapping, etc. to the practitioner, these feats may seem as mundane as tying their shoes. But to the unskilled, they are indistinguishable from sorcery.

Extramundane magic requires no special rules; just keep it in mind.

### Supernatural

Wizards like Merlin evoke through mere will phenomena which confound natural law. This is supernatural magic.

Supernatural magic is based on traits denoted as primarily magical. magical traits are useless for anything except magic and related pursuits (ex: impressing people with magic). In general, denote magical traits as "[purview] Magic".

Casting spells means contesting the spell's difficulty, like so:

* 1 rank: recognize works related to the craft (ex: "that's fire magic")
* 1 rank: know how to operate magical mechanisms within your purview (ex: activate or deactivate magical traps and switches)
* 2 ranks: move and bend phenomena within the trait's purview (ex: manipulate an existing source of flame)
* 2 ranks: conceal magical works from detection. Detecting a concealed phenomena means contesting the concealer's margin of victory during concealment.
* 2 ranks: provide protection against magical phenomena. (ex: a shield that protects against fire) The beneficiaries of such protection enjoy ranks of Protection from [trait] equal to your margin of victory, so long as you're focused on maintaining the spell.
* 3 ranks: create phenomena within your purview, with ranks equal to your margin of victory (ex: evoking a bonfire with Fire 3). Magical creations lose one rank every hour.
* 3 ranks: bolster existing phenomena, adding ranks equal to your margin of victory.
* 3 ranks: store a phenomena within your purview in a location, object, potion, etc., as some form of rune or other signifier. Such stores can be activated (or disabled) either by a mundane trigger (ex: the word "fudge"), or by most novice mages of the given purview. The potency of the spell stored is equal to the margin of victory from storing it.

By default, casting involves either a speaking, moving, writing, or material component -- your choice. To remove that requirement, increase the spell's difficulty (e.g. rank) by 1. 

Material components cost the spell's difficulty, and are expended in the casting. Spend that money when casting.

### Divine Possession

Acolytes of powerful deities may train their minds and bodies to act as instruments of their god, preparing themselves for the moment when it takes full control of their body, to exact its perfect will.

Gods are associated with particular traits, which they exhibit in infinite measure. Acolytes train themselves to more perfectly manifest those traits, so that when possessed, they enjoy more and more of them. Specifically, they acquire as many ranks of their god's traits as they have of their Acolyte of [deity] trait.

> Deus, the Lord of Hosts, is associated with Intimidation, Law, and War. The acolyte Kara has Acolyte of Deus 3, so when possessed by Deus, gains Intimidation 3, Law 3, and War 3.

To induce possession, the player spends three karma. Although cultures and traditions may have many rituals associated with inducing possession, gods act in their own sweet time. (though it can be very narratively satisfying to induce possession during such rituals)

Possession ends when the character is incapacitated, or falls asleep -- whichever happens first.

Although implied, Acolyte of [deity] traits do not necessitate knowledge of the deity. Instead, from a narrative perspective, players may decide that a deity has chosen their character as a champion without their knowledge (or their consent).

> Nali was too young for religion when raiders burned her village. Sobbing over her mother's body, she prayed to whatever powers she could imagine. When she awoke, she found herself gripping a knife protruding from the bandit king's body, while the whole troop's tents burned. Now in her twenties, Nali has become a reluctant but unmatched killer -- and the champion of forces she neither knows nor understands.

### Deals with Devils

Spirits may barter traits with mortals in exchange for goods, deeds, or other contractual obligations.

> Izzik, a fire imp, offers Jack a deal: every week that Jack brings Izzik a new puppy, Izzik will ensure Jack commands Fire Magic 1. If Jack fails to bring Izzik a new puppy, or the puppy is insufficiently cute, Jack will find his powers revoked.

Or, a little more gruesome:

> Badrik, Izzik's older brother, offers Jack a different deal: every time that Jack slays an innocent and bathes in their blood, Badrik will empower Jack with a rank of Blood Magic. Every day that Jack doesn't bathe in the blood of a freshly slain innocent, he will lose a rank of Blood Magic. If Jack runs out of ranks to lose, he will instead lose a point of durability as Badrik feeds on Jack's spiritual essence.

Spirits manage the fulfillment of such contracts, so if the spirit becomes incapacitated, or just changes their mind, the contract fizzles until re-established by the spirit's choice. Though they can cause contracts to fizzle, spirits cannot change the terms of their contracts without the other party's consent.

Alternatively, such contracts might be arbitrated and enforced by a higher power, so that if either a spirit or mortal breaches their obligations, more potent forces might get involved.

## Races

Races have three traits. Members of a race have at least one of those traits.

> Humans are Clever, Greedy, and Charismatic. Sarah decides that Jack starts with Clever 1 from being a human.

As a group, races are characterized by all three traits, but not every member of a race is a caricature of it. These traits may be a matter of physiology, cultural upbringing, geographic acclimation, etc.

Racial subsets may be characterized by a slightly different list of traits.

> Humans of the Northern Shore are Clever, Charistmatic, and Strong, after generations of naval raids.

Some races may be characterized by no traits, or by additional traits. If a race has no associated characteristics, it's said to be "lucky" and its members start with 5 karma instead.

> Fae, as a group, are not known for any particular behaviors. Instead, wherever they go, strange things happen.

Races with additional traits are characterized by more than three traits, and their members start with more than one of them, in equal measure. In turn, for each additional trait beyond three that characterizes a race, its members begin with a karma deficit of 5.

> Dark elves are Sly, Wanton, Violent, and Quiet. George decides that their character F'thal, a dark elf, starts with the traits Wanton and Violent. Sally decides their dark elf Ark started with Quiet 2. Both begin with a karma deficit of 5.

Players choose races for their characters either when play starts, when first asked about their race by anyone in-game, or anytime in-between.

### Race vs Species vs Culture

DoD calls anything that confers traits on characters prior to starting play a race. DoD races encompass everything from ancestry and physiology, to differences in upbringing and cultural heritage.

What characterizes a race is derived from the race's conception of itself. Stereotypes perpetuated by others about that group do not affect the traits that characterize it.

> Due to their reliance on trade to survive, the gnomes of the K'Thari Wastes are Hardy, Enterprising, and Charismatic. But, because of their nomadic and mercantalist ways, the capitol's gentry consider them thrifty thieves and tricksters.

Which races can interbreed, and other physiological concerns, is a narrative decision.
