# ADA Games

ADA is a family of pen-and-paper games, built on top of each other, for narrative-driven roleplaying experiences. It aims to be easy to learn, require few materials, and adaptable to any narrative.

The ADA family consists of three games:

1. A Dragon Appears: the original. Ideal for sudden roleplaying goodness with friends and strangers. Just say, "A dragon appears. What do you do?"
2. All Dragons Must Die: the core engine fleshed out with traits and karma to host longer, more involved games.
3. Dirge of Dragons: rules for combat, magic, character races, and scoping to specific settings add more grit and gravity.

All of the above games will always involve at least one narrator and some number of players -- ideally between one and four. Even more players can be hard to manage, but it's certainly doable.

Some terms:

* The Narrator: whoever tells the story. Generally, there's only one of these, but you can totally have several working together. Narrators are like referees, ensuring everyone has a good time.
* Players: people with characters in the game world.
* Characters: a player's in-game representative.
* Setting: the imaginary space the characters explore and adventure in.
